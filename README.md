🌱 Smart Agriculture Analytics

Smart Agriculture Analytics is a data-driven project designed to support farmers with better decision-making using locally collected agricultural data. The system analyzes soil, weather, and crop parameters, applies machine learning models for predictions, and presents the insights through interactive dashboards for improved agricultural planning.

🚀 Features

Local Data Analysis: Uses soil, weather, and crop datasets collected from local sources.

Crop Yield Prediction: Machine learning models forecast expected yield based on historical and local conditions.

Soil & Weather Insights: Evaluates soil moisture, pH, temperature, and other environmental factors.

Risk Identification: Highlights potential issues such as poor soil health or adverse weather patterns.

Interactive Dashboards: Visualizes trends, predictions, and recommendations using BI tools.

🧠 Objectives

Provide data-driven insights to support sustainable farming.

Use ML models to forecast crop yield and detect early signs of risk.

Help farmers plan better using simple and visual dashboards.
